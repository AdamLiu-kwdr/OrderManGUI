# OrderManGUI

This is my personal university project back in 2018, when I was sophomore in university.

OrderManGUI is an front end user interface for interaction with OrderManSys.

OrderManSys is an IoT management service backend. It takes an order of product, load the instructions needed to produce that product, and send it to AutoMan running in raspberryPi.
